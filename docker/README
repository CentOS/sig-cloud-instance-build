~/docker/

scripts, configs, kickstarts and utils we need to build
docker images

How to use these files:
  - There is an associative array in the buildcontainers.sh script that needs
an entry for each docker container to be built.

The format is containers['name']='tag'

When building on a CentOS host you will need EPEL[0] enabled with the following
packages installed:
  appliance-tools
  libguestfs-tools-c

NOTE - At this time, applliance-tools is still working on making it's way into 
EPEL official and can be obtained from the following location in the mean time:

http://maxamillion.fedorapeople.org/epel/el6/appliance-tools/

This script needs to be run as root or with sudo privs

./buildcontainers.sh 

The resulting container image(s) will be located in the current working dir 
with the format name-tag.tar.xz
